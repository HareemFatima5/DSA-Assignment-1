# Circular Linked List CPU Scheduling

This project implements a circular linked list to manage and schedule CPU processes using a fixed time approach. Each process is represented as a node in the circular linked list, allowing efficient traversal and removal of completed processes.

## Features

- **Circular Linked List**: Efficiently manages processes in a circular manner.
- **Fixed Time**: Each process is allocated a fixed time for execution.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Proper handling of process completion and memory cleanup.

# Flexible CPU Scheduling using Cicrular Linked List

This project implements a circular linked list to simulate a CPU scheduling algorithm. The program manages processes with their execution and remaining times, allowing for dynamic updates and scheduling.

- **Circular Linked List**: Efficiently manages processes in a circular manner.
- **Fixed Time**: Each process is allocated a fixed time for execution.
- **Dynamic Process Management**: Users can add new processes during scheduling.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Proper handling of process completion and memory cleanup.

# 1024-bit Primality Testing 

This implements a primality testing algorithm for a 1024-bit number using a in C++. The program generates a random 64-bit number and reconstructs a larger number to check its primality using the Miller-Rabin primality test.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Generates random 64-bit numbers to form a 1024-bit number.
- **Circular Linked List**: Uses a linked list to store and manage the large number.
- **Miller-Rabin Primality Test**: Efficiently tests if the constructed number is prime.
- **Display of Smaller Primes**: Lists smaller prime numbers for reference.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (e.g., vs code , visual studio)
